# simple-snake-game
The code is a JavaScript implementation of the classic game Snake, with HTML and CSS to display the game on a web page. The HTML code creates a basic structure for the page, including a canvas element for the game, a title, and a script element to link to the JavaScript file. The CSS code styles the body of the page with centered text and sets a border for the canvas element.
The JavaScript code defines several objects and functions for the game. The Keyboard object defines the keyboard input events and maps them to the directions the snake can move. The Stage object creates the game stage, including the snake and the food, and sets the game configuration. The Snake object initializes the snake and the food and provides the logic for the snake movement, collision detection, and score. The Draw object handles the drawing of the game elements, including the stage, the snake, the food, and the score.
The game works by using keyboard input to change the direction of the snake, which moves across the canvas in the chosen direction. The snake grows longer when it eats the food, and the game ends when the snake collides with the edge of the stage or with its own body. The score is displayed at the bottom of the canvas.
